# ProsperLoans Data Mining
Loan approval strategy success is awarded based on foresight and caution. These are only accomplished when an examination of both the customer and previous outcomes of customers with similar demographics is conducted. Any financial organization or bank understands that loans can be a complete miss. Situations happen where the loan is defaulted on, which can result in a total loss for the bank. Quantifying the measurements of instances like these, also of successful instances where the loan is paid in full, can create a model to predict the outcome. When this approach is taken, unrealized profit can be obtained while risk is mitigated. Industries around the globe classify customers in this manner. Prosper should have a similar process given its eligibility to do so. This project evaluates Prosper’s current model and provides a model that predicts if a customer’s loan will be a success or failure.

## Research Quesitons:
1. Does income range placement affect loan condition qualities?
2. Do certain occupations receive better loan conditions over others? Are term lengths evenly distributed?*
3. Are there variables that constitute a higher Prosper Score?
4. Are classifications or measurements evaluated by Prosper regarding loan applicants utilized in alotting them conditions?
5. Can loan outcomes be predicted for new customers who apply?

## Key Findings:
1. Machine Learning model predicts loan outcomes with 99.4% accuracy
2. This accuracy improvement has a monetary value of millions for Prosper
3. Customers of higher credit rating receive better conditions that lower ratings. This relationship is untrue for Income Range and Prosper Score.
4. Imputation algorithm outperforms random selection by 20x.
