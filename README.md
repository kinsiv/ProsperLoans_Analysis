# ProsperLoans Data Mining
Loan approval strategy success is awarded based on foresight and caution. These are only accomplished when an examination of both the customer and previous outcomes of customers with similar demographics is conducted. Any financial organization or bank understands that loans can be a complete miss. Situations happen where the loan is defaulted on, which can result in a total loss for the bank. Quantifying the measurements of instances like these, also of successful instances where the loan is paid in full, can create a model to predict the outcome. When this approach is taken, unrealized profit can be obtained while risk is mitigated. Industries around the globe classify customers in this manner. Prosper should have a similar process given its eligibility to do so. This project evaluates Prosper’s current model and provides a model that predicts if a customer’s loan will be a success or failure.

## Research Quesitons:
1. Does income range placement affect loan condition qualities?
2. Do certain occupations receive better loan conditions over others? Are term lengths evenly distributed?*
3. Are there variables that constitute a higher Prosper Score?
4. Are classifications or measurements evaluated by Prosper regarding loan applicants utilized in alotting them conditions?
5. Can loan outcomes be predicted for new customers who apply?

## Actionable Insights:
*Dataset size (N) is 55,071 loans.*
*Financial evaluations are calculated on profit average ($6,783.58) and derived from compound interest equation (yearly compound) with population averages entered. APR = 22%, length = 36 months, loan principal amount = $8314.76.*
1. Integrate 99.4% accuracy forecast model into the approval process.
2. Profit of $226,208,838 for a 258% gain.
3. ROI loss due to unpaid principle amounts at $2,789,880 from $141,434,067.
4. Minimize risk by appointing customers a numeric rating from the proposed red flag system. It accounts for common indicators such as Current Delinquencies, Open Credit Lines, and Bankcard Utilization.
5. Logistic Regression imputation outperforms random selection by 18x.
6. Credit Score is significantly proven to affect APR and the principal amount. It's recommended to incentivize benefits for affluential customers, those of higher income ranges ($75,000+).
